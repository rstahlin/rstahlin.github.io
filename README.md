# DC-COVID Tracking Project
As of now, I have a github page set up with non updated data and a few charts. Working on making charts.py from the ashes of my previous streamlit app so that it produces html charts that the webpage will reference. There's probably a better way to do this, but I don't know what I'm doing.
